# Project Proposal: College Football Success

## Team Members

Brendan Dowd, Nathan Kosiba, Spencer Harrison

## Proposal Statement

Our project is to uncover trends in college football data.  We'll examine relationships between indicators such as recruiting class, team game statistics (turnovers, passing/rushing yards), and rankings, and their effect on the success of a football team over the last 15 years of data.

## Research Questions

How much of an effect does recruiting rank have on the success of a team?  How long does it take for recruiting to impact the success of a school (case study)?  How much of an effect does the success of a school on recruiting?

Does the run/pass play calling distribution show and effect on the success of a team?

Does a teamâ€™s previous performance predict future success?  Is there a consistent trend leading up to a culminating event?

## Data Source(s)

We are using a college football statistics api located at https://api.collegefootballdata.com
